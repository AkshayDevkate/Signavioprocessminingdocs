# Solutions 

 | Solution | Description | Link |
 |--|--|--|
 |Operational Excellence | Outstanding customer experience is no longer the exception, it’s the expectation from consumers. This means that to remain competitive in your market, you need to continuously manage organizational complexity, and actively identify and act upon opportunities for improvement. Operational Excellence requires a considered and intentional look at your business processes, followed by action| https://www.signavio.com/highlights/operational-excellence/ | 
 | ERP trasformation | ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) transformation is a lucrative, yet undoubtedly risky endeavour. Despite the initial expense, bringing in a company-wide standardized software solution to streamline your processes, reduce human error, and easily extrapolate data analysis will result in long-term benefits. | https://www.signavio.com/highlights/erp-transformation/ |
 | Risk complience | The pace, complexity, and impact of change is affecting every vertical and organization, yet one thing remains constant - the need to proactively manage and mitigate risk and ensure compliance for your organization. Densely interconnected regulatory regimes coupled with more severe penalties are increasing the need to make Risk & Compliance management a critical part of operational and strategic decision making. | https://www.signavio.com/highlights/risk-compliance/ |
 | RPA at sale | Every business is on the lookout for the technologies and tactics that will give them an advantage over the competition, and robotic process automation (RPA) offers one way to get this vital edge. The power of RPA rests in increased efficiency and reduced costs, as well as the ability to truly unleash the creativity of employees by freeing them from uninspiring and menial tasks. With its promise of significant savings in staff costs, reduced repetitive work, and fewer errors and rework, robotic process automation is becoming increasingly common in all sorts of organizations. | https://www.signavio.com/highlights/rpa-at-scale/ |
 | Mapping customer journey | In the past, ‘customer experience’ was often the last issue companies considered, as they focused on sales and productivity. But no longer, as what was once called word-of-mouth is now fully branded user-generated content. A bad review, a shoddy product, or unfriendly service can be seen by millions, instantly. | https://www.signavio.com/highlights/mapping-your-customer-journey/ |
 | Process mining salesforce | With the Signavio Process Intelligence for Salesforce app, you can analyze your sales performance over multiple dimensions, and compare the effectiveness of your sales teams across regions, market segments or product lines.
